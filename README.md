# VIM syntax file for new easychair review form syntax

The [EasyChair review system](https://easychair.org/) changed the syntax of the
offline review form text files. This motivated me to update my old syntax files
from 2010 to the new version.

Installation is easy with your favorite plugin manager, e.g.,
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
````
Plug 'shuber2/easychair2-syntax'
````
